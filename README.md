# What is KitchenCI
Chef KitchenCI, commonly referred to as just "KitchenCI" or "Test Kitchen," is a powerful open-source framework and tool for automated testing and validation of infrastructure code. It is an essential component of the Chef ecosystem and is widely used by DevOps teams and infrastructure engineers.

KitchenCI provides a platform-agnostic testing framework, allowing you to test infrastructure code across different platforms, such as Linux, Windows, and macOS. It integrates seamlessly with popular testing frameworks like InSpec and Serverspec, enabling comprehensive and automated testing of infrastructure configurations.

The primary purpose of Chef KitchenCI is to automate the process of testing and validating infrastructure code, including Chef cookbooks and associated configurations. It ensures that the desired state of the infrastructure is accurately reflected by the code and that changes can be confidently deployed to production environments.

## Step for AWS

- Before edit the kitchen.yml, you should create and get the information from AWS Console for following resources,
    - AWS Subnet ID
    - AWS Security Group ID
    - AWS Keypair Name
    - AWS Keypair file location

## Update the Kitchen.yml file

- Update kitchen.yml as below

```
